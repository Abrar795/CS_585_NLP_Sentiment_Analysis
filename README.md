Overview
Welcome to our sentiment analysis project focused on stock market data! This repository contains the code and documentation detailing our approach to analyzing sentiments expressed in stock market-related text data. We've employed various machine learning algorithms, evaluation metrics, and visualization techniques to extract insights from the dataset.

Project Structure
data/: This directory contains the dataset used for sentiment analysis.
code/: Here lies the implementation of sentiment analysis algorithms and visualization techniques.
results/: This directory houses the output of our analysis, including evaluation metrics, ROC curves, and word clouds.
Features
Sentiment Analysis Algorithms: Implemented Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression algorithms for sentiment classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Utilized the ROC curve to assess the classifiers' performance.
Visualization: Generated word clouds to visualize positive and negative sentiments in the dataset.
